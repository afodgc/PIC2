    The establishment of deadlines, and work organization is important to evaluate the work progress and ensure better performance at all tasks.
    
    A Gantt Chart, was built and presented in figure~\ref{fig:Gantt} where the work was divided into tasks and stages spread throughout the year.

    The work started with the state-of-the-art research, presented in this document that will be furthered devolved deeper. 

    Then, as described in previous sections, some simulations will be developed to evaluate the solution proposal. After a reliable and robust solution is achieved, a prototype will be built in a proto board to validate the simulations without spending a lot of money and time. 

    When a successful prototype is achieved, the \acs{pcb} designed will start and ordered in the end of the process.

    Finally, firmware specifically made for the designed \acs{pcb} will be made alongside with hardware test and \ac{gui} development.

    After all hardware and software design, the board will be tested in real world conditions and the data will be analyzed and documented in the dissertation document.
