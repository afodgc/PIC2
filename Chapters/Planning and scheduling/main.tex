\fancychapter{Planning and Scheduling}
\label{chap:PandS}

    The establishment of deadlines and a structured work plan are essential for monitoring project progress and ensuring efficient task execution. To this end, a Gantt chart was developed and is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:Gantt}, in which the work is divided into tasks and stages distributed throughout the year.

    The work started with the State-of-the-Art research presented in this document that will be further expanded in the dissertation work. 

    Then, as described in previous sections, some simulations will be developed to evaluate the proposed solution. After a reliable and robust solution is achieved, a prototype will be built on a prototype board to validate the simulations without spending a lot of money and time. 

    When a successful prototype is achieved, the \acs{pcb} will be designed, fabricated, assembled, and tested.

    Finally, firmware specifically made for the \ac{mppt} charger will be made alongside with hardware test and \ac{gui} development.

    After all hardware and software design, the board will be tested alongside with \acs{sg01} in real world conditions and the data will be analyzed, and documented in the dissertation document.
