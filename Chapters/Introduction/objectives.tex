\section{Objectives}

This project  aims to design and implement a \ac{mppt} system for solar panels used in the TSB project. The \ac{mppt} will convert the energy produced by the solar panel as efficiently as possible with the use of a quality DC-DC converter and the implementation of \ac{mpp} tracking algorithms.

So the main objectives of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Study and understand the operation of solar panels and \ac{mppt} techniques;
    \item Chose the most suitable DC-DC topology for the system;
    \item Design and simulation of the hardware and software.
    \item Implement a fast response and efficient control algorithm;
    \item Implement the system in hardware and develop a \ac{pcb}.
    \item Test and validate the performance of the \ac{pcb}.
    \item Ensure the safety and reliability of the \ac{mppt} for its integration in the \ac{tsb} project.
    \item Provide data to the user about the performance of the solar panel and of \ac{mppt} through a \ac{can} communication interface.
\end{itemize}

By achieving these objectives, the project will contribute for a better control of the system, maximizing the data received from the solar panels to later improve the energy efficiency of the \ac{mppt} or even take conclusions about the manufacture quality of the solar panels build by \ac{tsb} project.
